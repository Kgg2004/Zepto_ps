Project Documentation: CTR Prediction and Product Ranking

1. Project Overview :
This project aims to predict the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and rank products based on search terms and city levels, utilizing classical machine learning techniques. The objective is to enhance user experience and product visibility on the platform.

2. Objective
- CTR Prediction: Estimate the likelihood of a product being clicked by a user.
- Product Ranking: Rank products according to relevance to search terms and city-specific preferences.

3. Data Description
- Data of the platform, including user interactions and product details.
- Features:
  - Numeric: latest margin , savings , total clicks etc.
  - Categorical: Query type, product category, product name , product subname etc.

4. Data Preprocessing
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyzed data distributions, relationships, and trends.
   - Identified and addressed missing and null values.

2. Handling Missing Values:
   - Numeric Data: No null values were found.
   - Categorical Data: Null values were handled by encoding the 'query_type' feature. Other less significant categorical features were removed to reduce complexity and computational load.

3. Feature Selection:
   - A correlation matrix was utilized to identify the relationships between features.
   - Features with an absolute correlation value with the target variable ('is_clicked') less than 0.05 were removed, as they contributed minimally to the prediction.

4. Standardization:
   - Important features were standardized using a standard scaler, applying the z-score method. This ensured that feature values were comparable, aiding in achieving more consistent model performance.

5. Modeling
- Train test split was done with test_size=0.25 and model was fitted with train data.
- Algorithm Used: 
  - Logistic Regression model was used for the classification task .
  - Hyperparameter Tuning was done with regularization to get the best parameters.      Regulariztion strength -100 and l2 regularization were the best parameters selected.
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Model performance was measured using accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. Achieved accuracy - 0.92 and auc score - 0.88

6. Product Ranking Methodology
1. Classification and Probability Estimation :
   - Products were classified based on search terms and city_id.
   - Predicted probabilities for the target variable ('is_clicked') were calculated.

2. Ranking Criteria:
   - Products were ranked using a pointwise ranking method, based on predicted probability and query_product_similarity.
   - If products had the same predicted probability, query_product_similarity was used as a tiebreaker.

3. Evaluation Metric :
   - The quality of the ranking was assessed using the Mean Average Precision (MAP) score, which evaluates the precision of the top-ranked items.

7. Results and Insights :
-The ranking system effectively differentiated products based on relevance, providing a meaningful and user-centric order.
